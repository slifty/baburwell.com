<h1>What is coming next: updated messages from Barbara</h1>

<p>With my third novel edited and ready for publication I am in that hidden valley of effort to find an agent or a publisher who will respond to my writing with the kind of enthusiasm my readers have. I have found this effort one of the most labor-intensive of my life. I know that many writers are familiar with the kind of energy one must draw upon to continue.</p>

<h2>Dark Truce:</H2>

<p>Like my first two novels, “Dark Truce” deals with members of a strong family who provide mutual support to each other through times of trial. The protagonist is a strong young woman who has suffered severe tragedy in her life, losing her husband in the Viet Nam war, and her baby daughter to a kidnapper. She raises her son, and we find the family waiting for him to come home from college for the Thanksgiving holiday. He is bringing with him a young woman he has fallen in love with, and when she walks through the doorway the drama begins and does not ease until a year later. At this time the circumstances of every member of the family have changed. Hopefully it will not be too long until this novel is in the hands of readers.</p>

<h2>The Awesome Power of Grief:</H2>

<p>This non-fiction book is also being marketed to agents and publishers. It grew from the deep grief I experienced when my youngest son, then 38 years old, was murdered in his home by a young man of 18 years, who is now in prison for this crime. The unusual thing about “The Awesome Power of Grief” is that it presents my raw and grimly devastating grief from the beginning moments of my knowledge of his death, expressing the confusion and debilitation of the weeks and months that followed, the value of grief counseling, the daily realities and the night visions that eventually led to my understanding that losing a child means living with the pain the rest of your life and integrating it into your being so that the power of grief can change life in a positive way. The second part of this book views the changes to my life prior to the tenth anniversary of his death, which occurs this month.</p>

<p>This was not an easy book to write, nor is it easy to read, but it is helpful, and leads both those who try to comfort and those who need comfort to have a better understanding of what comfort is, what grief is, and how both can exert awesome power in our lives.</p>

<h2>A Woman’s Psalms and Other Poems:</H2>

<p>Poetry has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I like the freedom of poetry that is not rhymed or metered, and I like the discipline of poetry that is. Both, to me, are beautiful.  I am in the process of pulling together a representative collection of my poetry, hoping to publish it. I will place two examples here, and change them occasionally. </p>

<h3>Psalm  7</h3>
<blockquote class="poem">
God knows<br />
I would change the world if I could. <br />
In my world peace would reign, <br />
the peoples of the earth would love each other, <br />
the hungry would be filled, <br />
the homeless housed, <br />
those without would have in abundance, <br />
equality would be more than a vague notion, <br />
none would harm another. <br />
 <br />
Why should I presume, <br />
in my brief span of time, <br />
to change what God could not <br />
through all the ages? <br />
 <br />
I turn my thoughts inward. <br />
There is one thing I can change: myself, <br />
leaving by the roadside garbage that I carry, <br />
cleansing myself of vanity, <br />
liking myself for right reasons <br />
rather than admiring myself for wrong ones, <br />
loving others rather than judging them, <br />
giving patience predominance over ill-will, <br />
giving a measure of goodness and hope <br />
to each whose path I cross. <br />
 <br />
"Be ye perfect," it was said of old, <br />
but perfectionism has its traps, <br />
one of which is blindness  <br />
to our distance from it. <br />
 <br />
Rather would I hear: <br />
"do better, be more kind." <br />
If I accomplish that a little at a time <br />
not only will I change <br />
but my corner of the world  <br />
might become a better place. <br />

<h3>Portrait</h3>
<blockquote class="poem">
Here come the sleek parading oldsters<br />
pastured now but prancing preening still<br />
tossing heads and kicking legs<br />
their races won their glory gone<br />
except for silver cups and mounds of gold.<br />
<br />
Hell they're not old you say<br />
they're going strong and looking great<br />
not slowed a whit<br />
amazing.<br />
<br />
But one old spavined mare<br />
limps toward shade to stand alone<br />
unnoticed unaware unmoving<br />
except to swish her tail at flies<br />
<br />
Why bother keeping such a nag you ask?<br />
Her insular career no less distinguished<br />
her trophy room a straw-lined stall<br />
she gave birth to winners<br />
then drew from chance a heftier load<br />
betraying bones and pain.<br />
<br />
Although her final sigh will bring relief<br />
she shuns the moment.<br />
<br />
Those who own her visit now and then<br />
to touch her scarred old hide in gentle ways<br />
she lives for that.<br />
Too the shade is easy on her eyes<br />
and oh the grass, though hard to reach, is sweet.<br />

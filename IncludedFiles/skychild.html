<blockquote>“an intriguing story about a child with a mysterious mission.”</blockquote></center>

<p>Angela, a long hoped for baby, arrives full of mystery, astonishing in appearance, beyond measure in intelligence, developmentally a miracle, and a complete joy to her parents and the team of professions who volunteer to guide her progress.  Why does she react fearfully to water?  Experience pain whenever she even hears of violence? Have an inexplicable relationship with trees? She moves through childhood experiencing violence and betrayal first hand, as those nearest to her marvel at their observations while trying to protect her from a world that couldn’t possibly understand and would probably exploit her for all the wrong purposes.</p>

<p>Skychild has, according to a Writer’s Digest editor, managed to develop a genre all its own. Part science fiction, part fantasy, part mainstream, filled with intrigue and spirituality, it brings many aspects of the human struggle for goodness to the written page.</p>

<h1>About Barbara Burwell</h1>

<p><img src="images/momflorida.jpg" height="125" align="left" alt="Picture" />In 1996 Barbara retired from her thirty year career as administrator and consultant in the fields of mental health and drug and alcohol. During that time she worked closely with clinicians who saw her as a welcome bridge to closing the gap between clinical and administrative goals. She achieved a national reputation for her work in the evaluation and improvement of mental health programs.</p>

<p>Barbara would be quick to tell you, however, that her professional career took second place to her calling as the mother to five children. As they have taken their respective places in the world, they continue to surpass even their mother’s hopes for them, which were always exalted. Tragically, her youngest son was killed at the age of 38. The powerful grief Barbara experienced changed her life and altered some of her long-standing beliefs.</p>

<p>Barbara lives in Harleysville, Pennsylvania, allocating her time to many activities in addition to writing fiction, non-fiction, and poetry. Most of her recreational activities center on family, including nine grandchildren and 2 great grandchildren.  Fly fishing is one of her favorite pastimes, granting her pleasant hours on the stream with her sons and daughter. She is an Episcopalian whose church is very important to her.</p>

<p>She brings an incredibly full and diversified lifetime of experiences to her writing. Barbara was an excellent golfer in her teens, and was 16 when she accomplished her first solo flight in a small aircraft – the answer to her dreams since she was three years old. She loves to read, knit, play the guitar and sing, cook, garden, and bird-watch.</p>

<blockquote>“I also bring to my writing a life-time spiritual journey. My characters represent people from the mainstream of life, who find themselves in extraordinary circumstances. Some of them are easy to love; others easy to hate, but all are strong, memorable, three-dimensional characters who elicit lingering feelings from their readers and whose spirits are inspirational.”</blockquote>

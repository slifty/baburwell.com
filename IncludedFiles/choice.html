<blockquote>“a thought-provoking read more on the reverence for life than the right to die . . .”</blockquote></center>

<p>The year is 2025.  People live longer, but resources dwindle and growing numbers of elderly have become a burden – thus is spawned a government sponsored euthanasia project called Hollowdale.  Matters of Choice follows the opening 3-week period and focuses on Levi, a young caseworker, who faces ethical, professional, and personal problems as he develops close relationships with his three assigned volunteers whose vibrant lives and spirits belie their choice to die.</p>
 
<h2>Reader responses to Matters of Choice:</h2>


<h3>“this book provoked a lot of questions, soul searching and deep        affections for many of its characters . . .”
<p> - Ann Ritchings, Episcopal Priest, retired.</p></h3>

<h3>“an alarming choice is given by a duplicitous bureaucracy.  Burwell describes the struggles four persons have made to act on this choice.  This book is gripping, astute, tragic, and life-affirming.  This is a book that is hard to put down.”
<p> - Catherine Hertzel, LCSW</p></h3>

<h3>“I haven't read anything that pulled me in like that in quite a while.  Very powerful . . .”
<p> - Barbara Walck, Editor, the Morning Call</p></h3>

<h3>“it is beautiful, inspiring, and very interesting . . .”
<p> - Mady Gomez, M.D. Psychiatrist</p></h3>

<h3>“I read this novel with much interest.  Now that I've reached my     90th, thoughts of the future are very imposing.”
<p> - Mrs.  Doris Bailey</p></h3>

<h3>“a difficult subject deftly handled.  The characters were 
well drawn and kept their characters throughout.  Honest dialog, not the least contrived, fleshed out the characters. . .”
<p> - Hugh Dorworth, Navy Pilot, retired.</p></h3>

<h3>“the descriptive work, the characters, the story, the book's substance all come together to present a unique, provocative work that I found very powerful.”
<p> - Tom Direnzo, Author</p></h3>
